# archlinux-installer
An Arch Linux Bash Script to run in the Arch Linux Live OS to install Arch the Arch way. This Script contains all my personal preferences and is specially adjusted for my purposes. Feel free to take a fork and adjust the script you like for your installation. This Script is continuously been improved. Feel free to create Issue-Tickets to let me know, if there are bugs to fix. Stay Arch and take care! :)
